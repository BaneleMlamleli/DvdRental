We are asked to write an information management application for a small DVD rental store that is just starting up. Movies and customers are to be stored in arraylists. To keep this project manageable, the maximum number of DVDs and customers for this application will be 10. Also, only one copy of each movie exists at the store.

Menu options are:
- Add
Sub-menu: 	Customer, Movie

- Delete
Sub-menu: 	Customer, Movie

- Sorted List of Movies
- Sorted List of Available Movies
- Sorted List of Customers
- List Movies that start withâ€¦
- Rent Movie
- Exit
